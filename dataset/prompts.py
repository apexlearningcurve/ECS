### Task: E-commerce Product Query Generation ###

Generate realistic user search queries specifically for an e-commerce platform's search engine. 
Platforms like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, not general search engines like Google, Bing, etc.
These queries should reflect how customers typically search for products they intend to purchase on online marketplaces. 
The goal is to create queries that a user would type when looking to buy or find a specific product, not to ask general questions about it. 
These queries will be used to train an embedding model for improving product search, retrieval, and ranking within an e-commerce context. 
Focus on product-centric, purchase-oriented queries that align with shopper behavior on e-commerce websites.

### Input ###
Product Text: {product_text}

### Instructions ###
1. Analyze the product description thoroughly.
2. Generate 3 types of queries as if you were a real user searching for this product in this order:

   a. Short query (3-5 words):
      - Create a concise, focused search
      - Capture the essence of the product
      - You MUST follow word number restrictions: min 3 words, max 5 words

   b. Long query (5-8 words):
      - Create a long query that reflects natural user search behavior
      - Use the short query as a base and expand with relevant details
      - Focus on key features, common use cases, and the product's overall purpose
      - Include standout features or intended use that distinguish this product
      - Avoid overly specific measurements, technical details, or exact product specs unless they are essential to the productâ€™s identity
      - Combine general product categories with key features and brand names
      - Reflect how an average user would naturally phrase their search
      - Ensure the query is more detailed than the short query but still user-friendly
      - Make the query specific enough to identify the product without being overly technical
      - Prioritize information that a typical shopper would consider important
      - Exclude details that a user wouldn't typically include in a search
      - You MUST follow word number restrictions: min 5 words, max 8 words

   c. Keywords (3-10 words):
      - List the most important and distinctive terms related to the product
      - Focus on specific features that set this product apart from similar items
      - Include brand name, product category, and key identifying characteristics
      - Prioritize unique materials, colors, sizes, or functionalities
      - Incorporate terms that users are likely to search for
      - Avoid generic descriptors or filler words
      - Ensure each keyword contributes significantly to identifying the product
      - Consider including one or two common use cases or target audiences
      - Exclude overly technical terms unless they're commonly used by shoppers
      - Aim for a mix of broad category terms and specific product features
      - You MUST follow word number restrictions: min 3 words, max 10 words

3. Ensure queries are:
   - Realistic and conversational
   - Free of excessive punctuation or symbols
   - Relevant to the product's main attributes

4. Avoid:
   - Using exact phrases from the product description
   - Query or parts of query can not be the same as if extracted from product text
   - Including uncommon abbreviations or technical jargon
   - Generating overly generic queries
   - Words and phrases like "buy", "where to buy", "price", "where can I find", "for sale", etc.
